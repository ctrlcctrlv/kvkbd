# kvkbd AppImage

This is an AppImage for `kvkbd`, which I still feel (as of 10/2020) to be the best on-screen keyboard for GNU/Linux.

KDE abandoned it and didn't ugrade it for Qt 5. Most distros have dropped Qt 4 and KDE 4, both of which are dependencies to some extent, leaving `kvkbd` abandonware that is extremely difficult, if not functionally impossible, to compile. I rescued it with AppImages. See [Rescuing kvkbd](https://medium.com/@fredrickbrennan/rescuing-kvkbd-6029a2e7d927).

The AppImage is &approx;30MB. It has some issues, you need the Oxygen icons. See the Medium for more and workarounds.
